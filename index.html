                <h2>Zuppa Toscana Soup</h2>
                <p>
                    This soup is a mimic of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.olivegarden.com/menu/homemade-soups/prod81927">Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana soup</a>.<br>
                    I actually got this recipe from my coworker's wife and altered it to my tastes.<br>
                    It's spicy but the amount of spice depends on how much Cayenne pepper you add and the type of sausage you use.

                <h2>Directions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Brown the meat with the leek (leek should be cooked through and soft), don't drain the meat(if you are looking for low fat you can drain the meat it just takes away some of the flavor).</li>
                    <li>Add the meat with leek, potatoes, bullion cube(s), bone broth, and stock to an 8qt pan.  Bring to a boil(approx. 212&deg;F or 100&deg;C)</li>
                    <li>Boil until potatoes are soft but not completely falling apart. At this point lower the temp to between low and medium.</li>
                    <li>Add the heavy whipping cream and Kale.</li>
                    <li>Add 1tsp Cayenne pepper, stir the pot then taste...if you want it spicier add 1 tsp and repeat.</li>
                    <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Once the Kale is cooked through the soup is done!  Ladle into some bowls and Enjoy!</li>
